#ncls3d
*ncls3d* is a lua script to convert an NCL application to its stereoscopic
counterpar  t. The final application can be executed in stereoscopic 3D
displays. Besides allowing an off-line conversion, it is also possible to use
*ncls3d* as an NCLua media object, allowing the conversion on the client-side.

## Usage
There are two main ways of using ncls3d: off-line or embedded in an NCL
application.

### Off-line
The off-line option allows you to generate the stereoscopic application at the
server-side. In order to do so, you should run ncls3d.lua from the command-line
with something like:

```bash
lua ncls3d.lua [-o <output>] <input>
```

This will take <input> as an NCL input file and generates a new NCL application
at the <output> file. A complete list of ncls3d.lua parameter is accessible
through:

```bash
lua ncls3d.lua -h
```

### NCLua
We also provide an ncls3d.nclua file that allows you to embedded the ncls3d
program in an NCLua application. In such a case you should add an NCLua 
`<media>` element in the

```xml
...
<media id="tos3d" src="ncls3d.nclua">
  <property name="url" value="original-2d_ncl_app.ncl"/>
</media>
...
```
When the above `tos3d` media object receives a start action (triggered by the
wrapper application), the conversion process generates the stereoscopic
application on the client-side and adds it to the wrapper NCL application,
presenting it to the viewer.
