# TODO
This is the TODO list for ncls3d.

## Bugs
  * Add ncls3d causalConnector to repository.
  * We are assuming that there is a connectorBase.
  * Take a look when the disparity put the media outside of the boundaries.
  * We should clone a <bind> only if the <media> pointed by this <bind> was
    cloned.
  * Add 'bounds' property to media objects. Maybe, we should work only with
    bounds properties.
  * We only need to add depth_control_template if there is any change
    in the spatial media properties (including depth property). Warning: Maybe
    this is not the solution, because the changes could happen in run-time.

## New features
  * Support for native stereoscopic video.
  * Handling only bounds, instead of individuals left/width/right.
  * Support for top/down output.
  * Handle animations.
  * Dynamic adaptability (allow to choose stereo or non-stereo execution mode).

## Tests
  * Animation
  * Test using NCLua object.
  * Dynamic changes in the depth and spatial properties.
