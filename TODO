# TODO
This is the TODO list for ncls3d.

## Bugs
  * We should clone a <bind> only if the <media> pointed by this <bind> was
    cloned.
  * Add 'bounds' property to media objects!
  * We only need to add depth_control_template if there is any change
    in the spatial media properties (including depth property).
  * Add onEndAttributionSet_var connector to the document.
  * Handle animations.
  * Dynamic adaptability (allow to choose stereo or non-stereo execution mode).

## New features
  * Support for top/down output.
