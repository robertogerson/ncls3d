This is the TODO list for ncls3d.

* We only should clone bind if the <media> that is pointed by the bind was
  cloned.
* Add bounds property to media objects!
* We only need to add depth_control_template if there is any change
  in the spatial media properties (including depth property).
* Add onEndAttributionSet_var connector to the document.
* Handle animations.
* Adaptability (allow to choose stereo or non-stereo execution mode).
